## 1. Product Vision

This website is **not** a résumé and **not** a static portfolio.

**It is:**

- a living record of progress
- a place where building happens in public
- a signal of taste, depth, and long-term ambition

**After browsing the site, a stranger should feel:**

> "This person is interesting, experienced, deeply passionate about AI and building, and clearly going somewhere."

---

## 2. Target Audience

### Primary Audience

- Fans / followers from existing and future channels
- People who resonate with building in public

### Secondary Audience

- Future co-founders
- Builders, engineers, product people
- Professional collaborators (not casual friends)

**Tone should stay professional, thoughtful, human — not overly casual or influencer-style.**

---

## 3. Core Identity (Narrative Anchor)

### One-line identity (no job titles)

> I'm a builder who completes missions — driven by curiosity, and the belief that building is how you can change the world.

### Current Role (contextual, not headline)

- AI Product Manager at a data annotation platform
- Focused on AI systems, tooling, workflows, and product design

**This is context, not your identity.**

### Now — "Current Focus"

**Purpose**

Keep the site alive and honest.

**Copy Structure**

> Right now, I'm focused on two things: life and work.

**Life**

- Fitness & physical training
- Reading and sharing books
- Music:
  - Erhu (Chinese traditional instrument)
  - Singing (semi-professional)
  - Guitar
  - Street busking

> These aren't hobbies on the side — they're part of how I stay grounded and creative.

**Work**

- Building products in public
- AI product thinking
- Sharing insights from:
  - podcasts
  - industry trends
  - things you're actively learning

**Optional "Last updated" timestamp.**

### Writing / Progress — "Thinking in Public"

**Purpose**

Create a habit-forming engine for the site.

**Positioning**

This is not a polished blog.

**Encourage imperfection.**
