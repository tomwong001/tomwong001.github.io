    content: "Growing up, I was always the kid who wanted to try everything — music, writing, trading, YouTube. I didn't have a plan. I had energy and curiosity, and I threw myself at anything that seemed interesting. Most of it didn't stick, but that restlessness taught me something important: I wasn't looking for a hobby. I was looking for something worth building.",

  {
    title: "The First Time I Tried to Build Something Real",
    content: "College at UCSD opened a new world. Data science, engineering, the first taste of what technology could actually do. Then CMU sharpened everything — systems thinking, product design, the craft of building. I started to see that the gap between an idea and something real was bridged by one thing: execution. I wanted to be on the execution side.",

  {
    title: "The Startup That Failed",
    content: "Steplify.ai was born out of genuine conviction. I believed in the problem. I believed in the product. I put everything into it — time, energy, money. And it didn't work. The market wasn't ready, the resources weren't enough, and a hundred small things went wrong in ways I couldn't have predicted. It's dead now. But I'm not bitter about it.",
    number: "03"
  },
  {
    title: "Why That Failure Clarified Everything",
    content: "Steplify failing didn't make me want to stop. It made me want to build better. I learned more from that one failure than from any class or job. I learned about timing, about product-market fit, about what it really costs to build something from zero. Most importantly, I learned that building is my path — not because it's easy, but because nothing else feels as real.",
    number: "04"
  },
  {
    title: "What I'm Building Toward Now",
    content: "I'm working as an AI Product Manager now — building systems, tools, and workflows that matter. But the job is context, not the destination. The real mission is bigger: build things that compound over time, share the process honestly, and attract people who think the same way. This website is part of that. Everything I do from here is in public.",
