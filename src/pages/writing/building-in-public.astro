        <p>The decision to document everything publicly wasn't easy. There's a natural instinct to wait — wait until you have something polished, something impressive, something "ready." But I've learned that waiting is just another form of hiding.</p>

        <h2>Why Public?</h2>
        <p>Building in public forces honesty. When you share your process — not just your results — you can't fake it. You can't pretend every decision was brilliant or every outcome was planned. And that honesty is exactly the point.</p>
        <p>I want people to see the real thing: the messy drafts, the failed experiments, the moments of doubt. Because that's what building actually looks like. The polished version is a lie by omission.</p>

        <h2>What I Hope to Gain</h2>
        <p>This isn't about attention or followers. It's about three things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Accountability.</strong> When you say you're going to do something publicly, you actually do it.</li>
          <li><strong>Connection.</strong> The right people find you when you show who you really are — not a curated highlight reel.</li>
          <li><strong>Compounding.</strong> Every post, every note, every update is a brick. Over time, they build something that no single piece could achieve alone.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Fear</h2>
        <p>Yes, there's fear. Fear of being judged. Fear of saying something wrong. Fear of looking like a beginner. But I'd rather be someone who tried and documented it than someone who waited for perfection and never started.</p>

        <h2>Starting Now</h2>
        <p>This website is the beginning. Not the polished version — the real version. I'll update it, break it, fix it, and keep going. That's the whole point.</p>
        <p>If you're reading this, you're seeing the first brick. There will be many more.</p>
